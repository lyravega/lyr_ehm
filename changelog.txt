Version 0.8.7

- Added a double-guard to prevent a null pointer exception caused by ship/fleet tracking
- Changed "Logistics Overhaul" to apply civilian conversion bonuses to a smaller selection of ships


Version 0.8.6a

Refactored and overhauled most of the stuff under the hood; initial changes begun on the previous versions, which are now all completed. Most of the 0.8.x versions didn't offer much in terms of gameplay, but with all these out of the way, parts of the mod that needs attention may get some. Hopefully.

- Fixed phase cloak checks of certain hullmods reporting incorrectly and blocking installation
- Fixed "Logistics Overhaul" not ignoring the hidden modular hull modifications in its checks
- Fixed an issue on base hullmod installation that added fixed built-in dmods back to the ship
- Fixed experimental hull modifications creating ghost categories in mission mode even though they were hidden
- Fixed undo button not getting disabled visually when it was supposed to
- Changed system retrofits so that they will be hidden if a the system is not found, instead of crashing the game on install
- Changed engine cosmetic mods to apply the campaign engine changes immediately on install and/or when settings are saved
- Changed ship/module tracking completely, which comes with a few non-gameplay benefits:
	- All of the ships in the fleet will be tracked when the refit tab is open
	- "Play Drill Sounds - All" option will do so when a hullmod is installed on / removed from any ship
	- Modules will not spawn unnecessary trackers or get confused by duplicates and instead use their own
	- Officer and autofit menus will not cause the trackers to detect false-positive changes on the ship
- Combined some logging settings, suppressed most messages for default setting


Version 0.8.5 - Hotfix

- Fixed a fatal issue* caused by a change in 0.8.4 that lead to slot not found crashes
- Changed "Logistics Overhaul" so that it cannot be installed on module-ships (for now)

* This issue completely escaped my radar, and it's extremely easy to reproduce. As it is a big issue, pushing this version as another fix


Version 0.8.4 - Hotfix

- Fixed an issue with ship restoration that lagged the game if the ship had any activated slot shunts
- Fixed launch tube description


Version 0.8.3

- Fixed a rare crash happened on load related to a listener
- Fixed Over-Engineered failing to refresh the ship display for any existing inert converters that it activated
- Fixed an issue that caused "Hull Restoration" skill to be more effective when "Quality Captains" mod was active
- Added OP cost to Over-Engineered (the OP cost matters only if "Progressive S-Mods" mod is installed)
- Added total flux capacity and dissipation bonuses (if any) to Mutable Shunt Activator's tooltip
- Added a new hullmod "Launch Tube Activator"; Mutable Shunt Activator no longer activates launch tubes
- Added a new hullmod "Logistics Overhaul"; strips the ship bare and repurposes it for pure logistics use
- Added "Hide Adapters/Converters" options; if enabled, the slot shunts will be hidden upon activation
- Added "Cosmetics Only" option; only cosmetic hull modifications will be available in the mod picker
- Added a "Debug Settings" section; enable/disable logging for certain items, display extra information on base hullmod's tooltip
- Changed "Play Drill Sounds" option; is now a selection with 'Experimental' (default), 'All' and 'None' options
- Changed how mutually exclusive mods behave; installation is not blocked anymore as the newer mod will remove the older one
- Changed slot retrofits to prevent installation and removal if there are wings or inert slot shunts present on the ship to prevent an issue
- Changed the OP bonus of Over-Engineered (back) to 20% (from 15%)
- Removed all experimental hull modifications from Missions; mission refit panel mod picker will no longer show any of these
- Removed all experimental slot shunt blueprints from known lists as it is redundant due to the ability

If you are using "Quality Captains", make sure it's up-to-date as there was an issue. Author of "Quality Captains" mod Dal has already made a change with "1.5.3" to ensure compatibility between the mods. Thanks Dal!


Version 0.8.2

- Added a new setting for slot shunt availability, both options* rely on the ability
- Added a new setting to control deployment point penalty for the hull modifications
- Unused slot points from hull modifications will no longer increase deployment point cost
- Missile Slot Retrofit suppresses built-in HBI if present
- Adjusted some icons and text colours, fixed a few tooltips
- Fixed a vanilla issue with the weapon groups

* "Always" (new, default) option makes slot shunts available whenever refit tab is opened
* "Submarket" (old) option makes slot shunts available only when docked at a port


Version 0.8.1

A new hull modification which turns automated ships to normal, or normal ships to automated. Its tooltip is dynamic and will tell you about bonuses / penalties. Having the skill "Automated Ships" is required.

Other than that, there are a few "balance" changes, and fixes. First thing that's thrown out of the window with this mod is balance but I'll still try to achieve some semblance of "balance" whenever I can. Even though it's probably impossible!

- Added a new hullmod "AI Switch"; turns automated ships into normal, and normal into automated
- Added energy version of HBI; built-in HBI is replaced with HEI when Mass Energy Retrofit is installed
- Over-Engineered slot point bonus changed to 1/2/3/5* (from 1/2/4/6), OP bonus lowered to 15% (from 20%)
- Slot points gained through Over-Engineered and Auxillary Generators increase DP by 1 per slot point
- Mass Missile Retrofit OP cost reduced to 6/12/18/30 (from 8/16/24/40). It now raises missile weapon OP cost by 2/4/8
- Fixed weapon checks ignoring activated shunts on the adapted slots which allowed adapter activator removal
- Fixed some incorrect text in the settings
- Updated some tooltips
- Restored the unmodification

* The game will load fine, but you may be in a slot point deficit. No penalties for this state, just a heads-up!


Version 0.8.0

Big version bump due to accomplishing another milestone; implementing fully customizable engines, and as a bonus, implementing LunaLib and taking advantage of its options menu for mods.

Make sure to delete the old mod folder as a different folder will be used from now on. Also, EHM now requires LunaLib (and LazyLib) to function. Old IDs are still in use for savegame compatibility.

Changes/Fixes:
- LunaLib integration; removed old .json files and moved necessary stuff to the new options menu
- Renamed some shield cosmetic hullmods to "Low-Tech", "High-Tech", "Midline" and "Crimson" shields
- Converted remaining shield hullmods to fully customizable* "Red", "Green" and "Blue" shields
- Added 3 fully customizable* engine cosmetic hullmods; "Red", "Green" and "Blue" engines
- Added full shield and engine customization options through the new options menu
- Added "Auxilary Generators" hullmod; provides 1/1/2/2 slot points at the cost of 10/10/20/20 OP
- (D) is removed, or if 'showExperimentalFlavour' is enabled, replaced with (E) from hull class names
- Fixed shunt market ability toggle not properly persisting through reloads
- Fixed value reduction on ships that persisted till a reload
- Hid the removal tool from .csv for now

* Shield customization is rather simple, however engine customization offers a lot with flexibility. All three customizable engines are tweaked like "Low-Tech" engines by default, however you can customize them like [REDACTED] ones as well if you so desire. Experiment as you wish!

Customizable cosmetic hullmods have a yellow triangle in the upper right corner of their icons, and their names can be changed within game as well. Most settings are self-explanatory, but some might require some experimentation to have an idea what they do.

To start customizing your shields/engines, simply open LunaLib's settings menu by pressing "F2" on the campaign layer. After that all you need to do is install the hullmod on a ship. When you save the new values, (most) changes will be reflected in the game immediately.



Version 0.7.3

- Added automatic clean-up for the slot shunts remaining in cargo holds after the shunt market interaction
- Added workarounds* to prevent possible crashes related to slot not found errors
- Fixed an issue with ship restoration that made refit tab unresponsive for a few seconds
- Fixed weapon checking; mass retrofits can now be installed on Invictus and Retribution (and alike)
- Added relevant tags to hullmods to prevent hidden ones from dropping as loot
- Updated out-dated slot shunt tooltips
- Improved Version Checker support

* These workarounds unfortunately cause a few "visual" issues:
- Ships that can be restored to their base versions will have their visuals restored immediately
- Restoration is still required and can be used to remove the d-mods, restoration cost remains the same
- Ships will be marked as (D)amaged even without any damage, but they will be identical to pristine ones
- The value loss due to being (D)amaged is negated, d-mods and actual damage still reduce value as normal



Version 0.7.2

Fixes:
- "Slot not found" crash related to d-hulls
- "Slot not found" crash related to mod ships using different slot numbering convention

Changes:
- Added an ability to control the visibility of the the shunt market

- Flux shunts (dissipator and capacitors) costs are removed (they weren't using any after activation)
- Flux shunts now grant 1.5 OP points worth of flux dissipation & capacity (+15 dissipation, +300 capacity)
- Flux shunts' multiplicative bonus to total is halved (reduced to 0.01)



Version 0.7.1

- Moved back to the old tracking system; should eliminate tracking related crashes
- Some unique mod-ships should be tracked by the "new" tracking system

Slot Shunts:
- Expanded on the "Adapter" idea, added "Diverters", "Converters", "Capacitors", "Dissipators" and "Launch Tubes"
- "Diverters" are used to divert power from a weapon slot to another, yielding slot points
- "Converters" are used to make a weapon slot bigger, using available slot points
- "Capacitors" boosts the total flux capacity of the ship
- "Dissipators" boosts the total flux dissipation of the ship
- "Launch Tubes" adds new fighter hangars to the ship

Hull Modifications:
- Renamed "Torpedo Engines" to "Crimson Engines"
- Added a new hull modification category: "Activators", renamed and moved "Step Down Adapter"
