Version 0.7.4

- (D) is removed, or if 'showExperimentalFlavour' is enabled, replaced with (E) from hull class names 
- Fixed shunt market ability toggle not properly persisting through reloads



Version 0.7.3

- Added automatic clean-up for the slot shunts remaining in cargo holds after the shunt market interaction
- Added workarounds* to prevent possible crashes related to slot not found errors
- Fixed an issue with ship restoration that made refit tab unresponsive for a few seconds
- Fixed weapon checking; mass retrofits can now be installed on Invictus and Retribution (and alike)
- Added relevant tags to hullmods to prevent hidden ones from dropping as loot
- Updated out-dated slot shunt tooltips
- Improved Version Checker support

* These workarounds unfortunately cause a few "visual" issues:
- Ships that can be restored to their base versions will have their visuals restored immediately
- Restoration is still required and can be used to remove the d-mods, restoration cost remains the same
- Ships will be marked as (D)amaged even without any damage, but they will be identical to pristine ones
- The value loss due to being (D)amaged is negated, d-mods and actual damage still reduce value as normal



Version 0.7.2

Fixes:
- "Slot not found" crash related to d-hulls
- "Slot not found" crash related to mod ships using different slot numbering convention

Changes:
- Added an ability to control the visibility of the the shunt market
- Mutable Shunt Activator now costs 2/4/6/10 OP instead of being free
- Flux shunts (dissipator and capacitors) costs are removed (they weren't using any after activation)
- Flux shunts now grant 1.5 OP points worth of flux dissipation & capacity (+15 dissipation, +300 capacity)
- Flux shunts' multiplicative bonus to total is halved (reduced to 0.01)



Version 0.7.1

- Fixed crashing due to trying to register non-experimental hull modifications
- Fixed wrong tooltip for Over-Engineered's +OP% bonus
- Fixed system slots interfering with ship weapon checks



Version 0.7.0

- Changed how player faction is determined (for Nexerelin)
- Over-Engineered now grants 1 slot points to frigates
- Changed the version file path to stable branch



Version 0.6.3

- Fixed a fatal issue



Version 0.6.2

Version 0.6.0

General:
- Added missing icons, sprites and whatnot to anything that required one
- Expanded the options in "ehm_settings.json" a little bit and added more entries to "ehm_localization.json"
- Moved back to the old tracking system; should eliminate tracking related crashes
- Some unique mod-ships should be tracked by the "new" tracking system

Slot Shunts:
- Expanded on the "Adapter" idea, added "Diverters", "Converters", "Capacitors", "Dissipators" and "Launch Tubes"
- "Diverters" are used to divert power from a weapon slot to another, yielding slot points
- "Converters" are used to make a weapon slot bigger, using available slot points
- "Capacitors" boosts the total flux capacity of the ship
- "Dissipators" boosts the total flux dissipation of the ship
- "Launch Tubes" adds new fighter hangars to the ship

Hull Modifications:
- Renamed "Torpedo Engines" to "Crimson Engines"
- Added a new hull modification category: "Activators", renamed and moved "Step Down Adapter"
- Added "Experimental Hull Unmodification" under all EHM categories; removes the base hull modification
- Added "Mass Missile Retrofit" modification; much more expensive than the others
- Added "Mass Small Universal Retrofit" modification; only affects small slots, cheaper than the others
- Added "Over-Engineered" under "Retrofits"; has no effect till it gets built-in, then it provides extra OP and slot points
- Added "Converter/Diverter Activator" modification; "Converters" use the slot points generated by "Diverters"
- Added "Mutable Shunt Activator" modification; Activates "Capacitors", "Dissipators" and "Launch Tubes"
