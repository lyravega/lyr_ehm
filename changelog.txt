Version 0.8.1

A new hull modification which turns automated ships to normal, or normal ships to automated. Its tooltip is dynamic and will tell you about bonuses / penalties. Having the skill "Automated Ships" is required.

Other than that, there are a few "balance" changes, and fixes. First thing that's thrown out of the window with this mod is balance but I'll still try to achieve some semblance of "balance" whenever I can. Even though it's probably impossible!

- Added a new hullmod "AI Switch"; turns automated ships into normal, and normal into automated
- Added energy version of HBI; built-in HBI is replaced with HEI when Mass Energy Retrofit is installed
- Over-Engineered slot point bonus changed to 1/2/3/5* (from 1/2/4/6), OP bonus lowered to 15% (from 20%)
- Slot points gained through Over-Engineered and Auxillary Generators increase DP by 1 per slot point
- Mass Missile Retrofit OP cost reduced to 6/12/18/30 (from 8/16/24/40). It now raises missile weapon OP cost by 2/4/8
- Fixed weapon checks ignoring activated shunts on the adapted slots which allowed adapter activator removal
- Fixed some incorrect text in the settings
- Updated some tooltips
- Restored the unmodification

* The game will load fine, but you may be in a slot point deficit. No penalties for this state, just a heads-up!


Version 0.8.0

Big version bump due to accomplishing another milestone; implementing fully customizable engines, and as a bonus, implementing LunaLib and taking advantage of its options menu for mods.

Make sure to delete the old mod folder as a different folder will be used from now on. Also, EHM now requires LunaLib (and LazyLib) to function. Old IDs are still in use for savegame compatibility.

Changes/Fixes:
- LunaLib integration; removed old .json files and moved necessary stuff to the new options menu
- Renamed some shield cosmetic hullmods to "Low-Tech", "High-Tech", "Midline" and "Crimson" shields
- Converted remaining shield hullmods to fully customizable* "Red", "Green" and "Blue" shields
- Added 3 fully customizable* engine cosmetic hullmods; "Red", "Green" and "Blue" engines
- Added full shield and engine customization options through the new options menu
- Added "Auxilary Generators" hullmod; provides 1/1/2/2 slot points at the cost of 10/10/20/20 OP
- (D) is removed, or if 'showExperimentalFlavour' is enabled, replaced with (E) from hull class names 
- Fixed shunt market ability toggle not properly persisting through reloads
- Fixed value reduction on ships that persisted till a reload
- Hid the removal tool from .csv for now

* Shield customization is rather simple, however engine customization offers a lot with flexibility. All three customizable engines are tweaked like "Low-Tech" engines by default, however you can customize them like [REDACTED] ones as well if you so desire. Experiment as you wish!

Customizable cosmetic hullmods have a yellow triangle in the upper right corner of their icons, and their names can be changed within game as well. Most settings are self-explanatory, but some might require some experimentation to have an idea what they do.

To start customizing your shields/engines, simply open LunaLib's settings menu by pressing "F2" on the campaign layer. After that all you need to do is install the hullmod on a ship. When you save the new values, (most) changes will be reflected in the game immediately.



Version 0.7.3

- Added automatic clean-up for the slot shunts remaining in cargo holds after the shunt market interaction
- Added workarounds* to prevent possible crashes related to slot not found errors
- Fixed an issue with ship restoration that made refit tab unresponsive for a few seconds
- Fixed weapon checking; mass retrofits can now be installed on Invictus and Retribution (and alike)
- Added relevant tags to hullmods to prevent hidden ones from dropping as loot
- Updated out-dated slot shunt tooltips
- Improved Version Checker support

* These workarounds unfortunately cause a few "visual" issues:
- Ships that can be restored to their base versions will have their visuals restored immediately
- Restoration is still required and can be used to remove the d-mods, restoration cost remains the same
- Ships will be marked as (D)amaged even without any damage, but they will be identical to pristine ones
- The value loss due to being (D)amaged is negated, d-mods and actual damage still reduce value as normal



Version 0.7.2

Fixes:
- "Slot not found" crash related to d-hulls
- "Slot not found" crash related to mod ships using different slot numbering convention

Changes:
- Added an ability to control the visibility of the the shunt market
- Mutable Shunt Activator now costs 2/4/6/10 OP instead of being free
- Flux shunts (dissipator and capacitors) costs are removed (they weren't using any after activation)
- Flux shunts now grant 1.5 OP points worth of flux dissipation & capacity (+15 dissipation, +300 capacity)
- Flux shunts' multiplicative bonus to total is halved (reduced to 0.01)



Version 0.7.1

- Fixed crashing due to trying to register non-experimental hull modifications
- Fixed wrong tooltip for Over-Engineered's +OP% bonus
- Fixed system slots interfering with ship weapon checks

Version 0.6.0

General:
- Added missing icons, sprites and whatnot to anything that required one
- Expanded the options in "ehm_settings.json" a little bit and added more entries to "ehm_localization.json"
- Moved back to the old tracking system; should eliminate tracking related crashes
- Some unique mod-ships should be tracked by the "new" tracking system

Slot Shunts:
- Expanded on the "Adapter" idea, added "Diverters", "Converters", "Capacitors", "Dissipators" and "Launch Tubes"
- "Diverters" are used to divert power from a weapon slot to another, yielding slot points
- "Converters" are used to make a weapon slot bigger, using available slot points
- "Capacitors" boosts the total flux capacity of the ship
- "Dissipators" boosts the total flux dissipation of the ship
- "Launch Tubes" adds new fighter hangars to the ship

Hull Modifications:
- Renamed "Torpedo Engines" to "Crimson Engines"

- Added "Mass Missile Retrofit" modification; much more expensive than the others
- Added "Mass Small Universal Retrofit" modification; only affects small slots, cheaper than the others
- Added "Over-Engineered" under "Retrofits"; has no effect till it gets built-in, then it provides extra OP and slot points
- Added "Converter/Diverter Activator" modification; "Converters" use the slot points generated by "Diverters"
- Added "Mutable Shunt Activator" modification; Activates "Capacitors", "Dissipators" and "Launch Tubes"
