## **Experimental Hull Modifications**
Just some hull modifications. By some, I mean 40+ or something. However, most are mutually exclusive, so the usable list is rather short actually. On a new game or a load, all hull modifications and slot shunts will be added to player's known list. Any port you visit will have a new submarket where you can grab slot shunts from.

- Over-Engineered: Provides 20% OP bonus and some slot-points to the ship when built-in. Resides under "Retrofit" category
