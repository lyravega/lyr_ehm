## **Experimental Hull Modifications**
Just some hull modifications. By some, I mean 40+ or something. However, most are mutually exclusive, so the usable list is rather short actually. On a new game or a load, all hull modifications will be added to player's known list. Slot shunts too, however you'll need a small industry to build them. Or you can use console to give yourself a few.
