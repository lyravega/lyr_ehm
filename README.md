Experimental Hull Modifications v

Just some hull modifications. By some, I mean 60 something. Most are mutually exclusive, so the list is rather short actually. Experimental on the name is not just for posterity, as all mods butcher the hullSpecs. Currently offers these categories:

• Systems: Ship System Retrofits
All vanilla systems are turned into a hullMod. Some are hidden as they are designed for [REDACTED] or used by stations. All use flat costs, nothing adjusted beyond the initial addition.

• Retrofits: Weapon Slot Retrofits & Slot Adapters
Retrofits that alters the weapon slots. Basic ones do a ship-wide slot conversion, advanced ones (adapters) do interesting things like turning slot into two smaller ones. 

• Cosmetics: Shield & Engine Cosmetics
Cosmetic hullmods that change the shield and engine colours. 

Also features some scripts to track added/removed hullmods on ships, which can be used to trigger jury-rigged 'onAdded()' / 'onRemoved()' methods remotely, to track the fleet, and to refresh the refit screen on demand.
